Want to make the search better:
- Have search recommendations based on country typed or something maybe


Potential enhancements:
WeatherMap - If you want to add a map view

LocationButton - Get user's current location

RecentSearches - List of recently searched locations (or just better search functionality)

Allow users to save some locations
- Maybe save some as favourites, which would then display somewhere like a header
- Then they would display the updated weather data on a smaller card

Add forecast data
