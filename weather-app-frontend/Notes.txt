1. Want to make the search better:
- Search validation stuff (do this first)
    - Validate input format (e.g., no special characters)
    - Show helpful error messages
    - Handle different types of API errors gracefully (how to do this?)
    - Provide feedback about invalid locations


- Autocomplete/Search Suggestions
    - Create an endpoint in your backend that returns city suggestions based on partial input
    - Use debouncing to prevent too many API calls while typing
    - Show suggestions in a dropdown below the search input
    - Allow keyboard navigation (up/down arrows) through suggestions
    - Allow clicking on suggestions to select them

Considerations:
- How many suggestions to show?
- When to start showing suggestions (e.g., after 2 characters)?
- How to handle loading states during suggestion fetching?



2. Allow users to save some locations (favourites) -> maybe use context
- Maybe save some as favourites, which would then display somewhere like a header
- Then they would display the updated weather data on a smaller card


3. Add forecast data


4. WeatherMap - If you want to add a map view


5. LocationButton - Get user's current location


6. Popular / Featured locations
- Create a list of common cities
- Show them when input is focused but empty
- Allow quick selection

Considerations:
How to determine what's "popular"?
How to organize them (by country, continent, etc.)?
-> Perhaps organise based on user's location -> what's nearby
